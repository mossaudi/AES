        "# Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System for CSV Files\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This code implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for processing and querying CSV documents. The system encodes the document content into a vector store, which can then be queried to retrieve relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "# CSV File Structure and Use Case\n",
        "The CSV file contains dummy customer data, comprising various attributes like first name, last name, company, etc. This dataset will be utilized for a RAG use case, facilitating the creation of a customer information Q&A system.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Loading and spliting csv files.\n",
        "2. Vector store creation using [FAISS](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/) and OpenAI embeddings\n",
        "3. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents\n",
        "4. Creating a question and answer over the csv data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method Details\n",
        "\n",
        "### Document Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The csv is loaded using langchain Csvloader\n",
        "2. The data is split into chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Vector Store Creation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text chunks.\n",
        "2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retriever Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A retriever is configured to fetch the most relevant chunks for a given query.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.\n",
        "2. Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.\n",
        "3. Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
        "4. Integration with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This simple RAG system provides a solid foundation for building more complex information retrieval and question-answering systems. By encoding document content into a searchable vector store, it enables efficient retrieval of relevant information in response to queries. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring quick access to specific information within a csv file."
